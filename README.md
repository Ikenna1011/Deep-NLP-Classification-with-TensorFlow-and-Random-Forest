# Deep NLP Classification with TensorFlow and Random Forest

Welcome to the **Deep NLP Classification with TensorFlow and Random Forest** repository! This project showcases a robust pipeline for natural language processing (NLP) classification tasks. The primary goal is to classify textual data, such as chatbot responses and resumes, into categories like "flagged" or "not flagged."

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare raw text data for analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Gain insights into the dataset through visual exploration.
- **Model Building**: Leverage TensorFlow for deep learning and Random Forest for ensemble learning.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the models using various metrics.

## Use Cases

- **Chatbot Moderation**: Automatically flag inappropriate or sensitive responses.
- **Resume Screening**: Classify resumes based on predefined criteria for recruitment purposes.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ikenna1011/Deep-NLP-Classification-with-TensorFlow-and-Random-Forest.git/
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the pipeline:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
